**A modern, high-performance, single-file HTML5 landing page designed for Game Server Communities.**

This project was built to provide a stylish, "Cyberpunk/Neon" themed entry point for the **Darkcore** community, featuring a fully responsive design that works perfectly on mobile and desktop.

## ✨ FEATURES

* **⚡ Single File Architecture:** No complex build steps, no JavaScript frameworks. Just one lightweight `index.html` file containing all HTML and CSS.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** "Mobile-First" approach ensures the site looks great on phones, tablets, and 4K monitors.
* **🎨 Cyberpunk Design:** Custom CSS variables for easy theming (Neon Purple/Pink aesthetics).
* **💨 High Performance:** Loads instantly, optimized for speed.
* **🛠️ Easy Customization:** All content (IP address, Discord link, Server status) can be edited directly in the HTML.

## 🛠️ INSTALLATION & SETUP

Since this is a static site, you don't need a backend server.

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaron-devop/darkcore-landing.git
```

### 2. Edit Content
Open `index.html` in any code editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.) and look for these sections to customize:

* **Discord Link:** Search for `https://discord.gg/your-code` and replace it.
* **Server IP:** Search for `play.darkcore.hu`.
* **Player Count:** Search for `124`.

### 3. Deploy
Upload the `index.html` to **GitHub Pages**, Netlify, or your own VPS web root (e.g., `/var/www/html`).

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION

You can easily change the color scheme by modifying the CSS Variables at the top of the `<style>` section:

```css
:root {
    --bg-dark: #09090b;       /* Background Color */
    --accent-primary: #6366f1; /* Main Neon Color (Indigo) */
    --accent-secondary: #ec4899; /* Secondary Neon Color (Pink) */
}
```
